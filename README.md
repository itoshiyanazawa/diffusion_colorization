# Colorization of Historical Photographs using Diffusion Model

## Objective
The goal of this research is to colorize historical photographs using a diffusion model to improve their quality and contribute to research in the field of history. Colorization can enhance the clarity of photographs, allowing for better understanding of past situations and environments.

## Methodology
1. **Dataset**: The Historical Color Image Database, containing 1325 images taken between 1930 and 1970, was used for training and evaluation.
2. **Models**:
  - **Diffusion Model**: The palette model available on GitHub was used for colorization.
  - **Pix2Pix**: A comparative model based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image-to-image translation.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Images were resized to 256x256 and converted to grayscale using Python libraries (PIL and OpenCV).
4. **Training**: Original images and grayscale images were used as input-output pairs for training both models.
5. **Evaluation**:
  - **Quantitative**: Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID), Inception Score (IS), and Mean Squared Error (MSE) were used for evaluation.
  - **Qualitative**: Visual evaluation and survey-based comparison between diffusion model and pix2pix outputs.

## Results
- The diffusion model outperformed pix2pix in terms of FID (30.00 vs. higher) and IS (11.28 vs. lower) scores.
- 88% of survey respondents found the diffusion model's colorization results more natural and free from artifacts compared to pix2pix.
- The diffusion model successfully colorized both human and machine subjects, while pix2pix struggled with various subjects.

## Conclusion
The diffusion model proved to be the superior choice for colorizing historical photographs, providing better quality and more consistent results across different subjects. This technique can be valuable for historical research, enabling a better understanding of the past through enhanced visual information.
